# salesforce-alm

**This code is read-only and not meant to be executed, edited, or contributed to.** 

This repository represents a snapshot of the (salesforce-alm)[https://www.npmjs.com/package/salesforce-alm] (commonly referred to as the toolbelt) plug-in source code for the (Salesforce CLI)[https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/sfdxcli]. It is the largest plugin for the CLI and contains most of the force commands, including (Source format)[https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/modules/sfdx_dev_model/sfdx_dev_model_sdd] and conversion. 

The CLI teamâ€™s eventual goal is to completely open-source salesforce-alm, along with all repositories and plugins for the Salesforce CLI. Our plan is to move the code in chucks as we breakup the toolbelt into plug-ins and open source as we go. Due to an overwhelming number of requests to look at the salesforce-alm code and the fact that it will take a significant amount of engineering hours to migrate our development and build process to an open source repository, we are providing this snapshot as a stopgap.

Updates: We plan to release an update of this code every Salesforce Release (three times per year). This way the community will be able to investigate any changes to the toolbelt as they come out.

Please continue to provide feedback at the (Salesforce CLI issues only repo)[https://github.com/forcedotcom/cli]. We will not be accepting PRs to this repository.
